About Haiti Quake People Finder
The purpose of the Haiti Quake People Finder is to help locate friends and family (we call them survivors because we are hopeful they are) who were in Haiti when the earthquake of January 12, 2010 hit.

With Haiti Quake People Finder, you can keep track of the status of friends and family as well as update and share information with Facebook friends. The main goal is to create a socially updated database of these “survivors” that is as accurate as possible, considering the current limited means of communications with Haiti.
