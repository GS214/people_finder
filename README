About People Finder
The purpose of the Facebook People Finder is to help locate friends and family (we call them survivors because we are hopeful they are) who are lost during disasters.

This application was first created for the Haiti Quake of Jan 12, 2010 and refactored/generalized and open-sourced to be released for the great quake of March 11, 2011 in the north of Japan.

With Facebook People Finder, you can keep track of the status of friends and family as well as update and share information with Facebook friends. The main goal is to create a socially updated database of these “survivors” that is as accurate as possible, considering the current limited means of communications with disaster areas.
